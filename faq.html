      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 2rem auto;">
        <h3>How does the service work?</h3>
        <p>
          You tell us your budget, origin and preferences. We research
          flights, stays, cars and experiences to maximize value and
          minimize cost. You choose your favorite itinerary and we handle
          the booking or provide links so you
          can book yourself.
        </p>

        <h3>Do you only work with young travelers?</h3>
        <p>
          No. We specialize in under‑25 travel because there’s a gap in the
          market, but we work with travelers of all ages. Our Young
          Traveler Advantage just means we have extra expertise in
          unlocking deals for students and young professionals.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I have to pay for the trip through you?</h3>
        <p>
          Only if you select a Concierge or Group package. 
          For Deal Finder, we send you booking links so you can pay
          directly with airlines, hotels or rental agencies. Concierge and
          Group clients authorize payment via a secure form and we make the
          bookings on your behalf.
        </p>

        <!-- Additional FAQs added to address common concerns -->
        <h3>How long does it take to receive my itinerary?</h3>
        <p>
          It depends on the package you select. For Deal Finder,
          we turn around your research within 72 hours. Concierge
          and Group plans may take a bit longer because we handle the
          bookings and negotiations, but you’ll always receive an initial
          proposal within 4 business days. Need it sooner? Ask about rush
          service.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the Value Score?</h3>
        <p>
          The Value Score is our way of quantifying how much money we save
          you compared to typical retail prices. We look at historical
          averages for flights, lodging and cars, then calculate a score
          based on the percentage saved. A higher Value Score means you’re
          getting more trip for your money.
        </p>

        <h3>Are planning fees refundable?</h3>
        <p>
          Planning fees cover the time and research required to uncover
          the best deals. If we can’t provide at least two flight and
          lodging options within your stated budget, we’ll credit your
          payment toward a future trip or refund 50%, your choice.
          Otherwise, planning fees are non‑refundable once research
          begins.
