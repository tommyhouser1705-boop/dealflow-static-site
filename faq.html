      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 2rem auto;">
        <h3>How does the service work?</h3>
        <p>
          You tell us your budget, origin and preferences. We research
          flights, stays, cars and experiences to maximise value and
          minimise cost. You choose your favourite itinerary and we handle
          the booking (Concierge and Group tiers) or provide links so you
          can book yourself (Lite and Budget Explorer).
        </p>

        <h3>Do you only work with young travellers?</h3>
        <p>
          No. We specialise in under‑25 travel because there’s a gap in the
          market, but we work with travellers of all ages. Our Young
          Traveller Advantage just means we have extra expertise in
          unlocking deals for students and young professionals.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I have to pay for the trip through you?</h3>
        <p>
          Only if you select a Concierge or Group package. For Lite and
          Budget Explorer, we send you booking links so you can pay
          directly with airlines, hotels or rental agencies. Concierge and
          Group clients authorise payment via a secure form and we make the
          bookings on your behalf.
        </p>

        <h3>What if my trip gets more expensive after I book?</h3>
        <p>
          Many providers allow free changes or cancellations within a
          certain timeframe. If your plan includes Flexible Repricing
          monitoring, we’ll rebook or adjust your reservation when a
          better price appears.
        </p>

        <h3>Which destinations do you know best?</h3>
        <p>
          Tommy has personally researched and visited dozens of countries,
          but his specialties are Ireland, Prague, Hawaii and the U.S.
          Southeast. That said, we love a challenge — tell us where you
          want to go and we’ll dive into the data.
        </p>

        <!-- Additional FAQs added to address common concerns -->
        <h3>How long does it take to receive my itinerary?</h3>
        <p>
          It depends on the package you select. For Budget Explorer and Lite
          plans, we turn around your research within 72 hours. Concierge
          and Group plans may take a bit longer because we handle the
          bookings and negotiations, but you’ll always receive an initial
          proposal within 4 business days. Need it sooner? Ask about rush
          service.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the Value Score?</h3>
        <p>
          The Value Score is our way of quantifying how much money we save
          you compared to typical retail prices. We look at historical
          averages for flights, lodging and cars, then calculate a score
          based on the percentage saved. A higher Value Score means you’re
          getting more trip for your money.
        </p>

        <h3>Are planning fees refundable?</h3>
        <p>
          Planning fees cover the time and research required to uncover
          the best deals. If we can’t provide at least two flight and
          lodging options within your stated budget, we’ll credit your
          payment toward a future trip or refund 50%, your choice.
          Otherwise, planning fees are non‑refundable once research
          begins.
        </p>

        <!-- Responsibilities FAQ to clarify what the planner does for each package -->
        <h3>What do you handle for each package?</h3>
        <p>
          Our service tiers correspond to different levels of involvement. For Budget
          Explorer and Lite plans we focus on research and inspiration: we
          analyse prices and destinations for you, compile two to three
          itineraries and send you booking links so you can finalise the trip
          yourself. Concierge clients receive hands‑on planning: we search,
          negotiate and book flights, lodging and cars using your payment
          information and deliver a complete travel packet. Group and Premium
          projects include all of the above plus coordination among
          travellers, payment splitting, activity reservations and real‑time
          support during your trip.
