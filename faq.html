      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 2rem auto;">
        <h3>How does the service work?</h3>
        <p>
          You tell us your budget, origin and preferences. We research
          flights, stays, cars and experiences to maximise value and
          minimise cost. You choose your favourite itinerary and we handle
          the booking (Concierge and Group tiers) or provide links so you
          can book yourself (Lite and Budget Explorer).
        </p>

        <h3>Do you only work with young travellers?</h3>
        <p>
          No. We specialise in under‑25 travel because there’s a gap in the
          market, but we work with travellers of all ages. Our Young
          Traveller Advantage just means we have extra expertise in
          unlocking deals for students and young professionals.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I have to pay for the trip through you?</h3>
        <p>
          Only if you select a Concierge or Group package. For Lite and
          Budget Explorer, we send you booking links so you can pay
          directly with airlines, hotels or rental agencies. Concierge and
          Group clients authorise payment via a secure form and we make the
          bookings on your behalf.
        </p>

        <h3>What if my trip gets more expensive after I book?</h3>
        <p>
          Many providers allow free changes or cancellations within a
          certain timeframe. If your plan includes Flexible Repricing
          monitoring, we’ll rebook or adjust your reservation when a
          better price appears.
        </p>

        <h3>Which destinations do you know best?</h3>
        <p>
          Tommy has personally researched and visited dozens of countries,
          but his specialties are Ireland, Prague, Hawaii and the U.S.
          Southeast. That said, we love a challenge — tell us where you
          want to go and we’ll dive into the data.
